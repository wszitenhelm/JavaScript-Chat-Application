                <h3>Welcome to my website. I created this website to use it as my personal portfolio. It was
                also a good chance to realize which of my passions are the most important and are worth mentioning. 
                Despite travelling which is mine main passion, I have also others that also influence my 
                life. <br> Site was developed using HTML 5. Creating this webiste I used knowledge gained during course 
                at the univeristy called "CS1031 Web Development" but I was also searching online for the best solutions. </h3>

                <h3>Cooking & Baking</h3>
                <h5>Eating is a thing we all need to do and at some point I realized that if I can't live without it I should make
                it more special. I started trying new recipes, new vegetables and spices and with time cooking became my passion.
                Probably my friends and family helped me with developing this passion because usually when I cook I do it for them.
                Right now I like the most baking because every day is better with a little dessert or two.</h5>

                <h3>Healthy Lifestyle</h3>
                <h5>Getting older I noticed that the way people take care of their body affects their future life.
                I love my life and I want to live long to make all my dreams come true and that's why 
                I decided to lead healthy life style. What I mean by that is not only attending gym, but also
                avoiding fastfood, moving a lot during day and trying to reduce stress. I am happy to have a lot 
                of people around me that also try to lead better lifestyle. </h5>
